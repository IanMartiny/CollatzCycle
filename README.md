# CollatzCycle

Result from [Eliahou](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X9390052U) gives that we can put a lower bound on the number of elements in a non-trivial cycle of the Collatz iteration (if one exists). 

Using this method we can get system of equations that all must point to the same number. That system is:

```
24727*a_1 +  75235*b_1  +  50508*c_1   = |S|
75235*a_2 + 125743*b_2 + 176251*c_2 = |S|
```
