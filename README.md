# CollatzCycle

Result from [Eliahou](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X9390052U) gives that we can put a lower bound on the number of elements in a non-trivial cycle of the Collatz iteration (if one exists). 

Using this method we can get system of equations that all must point to the same number. That system is:

$$
24727\cdot a_1 + 75235\cdot b_1 + 50508\cdot c_1 = |S|
$$
